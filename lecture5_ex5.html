<h2>Aladdin</h2> 
<div id="div1"> <img src="aladin.jpg">
<p><em>If you imagine Aladdin in a videotape as a child, you are mistaken.</em><br> 
Aladdin, which has emerged as the hottest musical in New York, is Klook's first pick! <br>
If you listen to the splendid stage directing of Disney Productions that you can't take your eyes off of 
<br>and the familiar music that you've heard before, you'll fall in love with the performance in an instant.<br></p>
<p>Aladdin, a musical that sings of infinite possibilities with one lamp and three wishes, is the best for everyone from adults to children.<br>
A new song created for the musical by Oscar-winning composer Alan Menken also provides another level of
enjoyment.</p> </div> 
<div id="div2">Aladdin's performance runs until July 7, 2022.</div>
